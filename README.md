## Deployments

### GitHub to Pantheon
Deployments to the dev Pantheon environment are managed through CircleCI.

Pull requests will build a MultiDev environment then update the PR with a
comment. We also have Lighthouse testing and other audits enabled.

Merges to `main` will merge and deploy the GitHub code to the Pantheon dev
environment.

### Pantheon dev to prod deployments
1. Go to the project dashboard on Pantheon.
1. Backup databases for Test and Dev.
    1. To accomplish this you can go to the backups tab and backup everything
    or go to Database/Files and under Export 'export the database'.
1. Go to the environment you want to deploy to and make note of the tickets
that are ready to deploy, document these in the deploy log message.
1. Once content has been deployed clone the Test database down to Dev.
1. Pull the database locally, make sure there are no config changes
that need to be committed to code.
If there are changes, commit those and deploy.
1. Tell the appropriate Slack channel that a deployment has taken place
and include which tickets were deployed.

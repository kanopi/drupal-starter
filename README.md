### Step #2: Project setup

1. Clone this repo into your Projects directory

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kanopi/drupal8-composer-docksal.git drupal8
    cd drupal8
    ```

2. Initialize the site

    This will initialize local settings and install the site via drush

    ```
    fin init
    ```

3. **On Windows** add `192.168.64.100  drupal8.docksal` to your hosts file

4. Point your browser to

    ```
    http://drupal8.docksal
    ```

When the automated install is complete the command line output will display the admin username and password.

## Automate more with 'fin init'

Site provisioning can be automated using `fin init`, which calls the shell script in [.docksal/commands/init](.docksal/commands/init).  
This script is meant to be modified per project. The one in this repo will give you a good example of an advanced init script.

Common tasks that can be handled by the init script include:

- compile Sass
- run PHPCS (a PHP Code Sniffer on a given path)
- initialize local settings files for Docker Compose, Drupal, Behat, etc.
- import DB or perform a site install
- run DB updates, revert features, clear caches, etc.
- enable/disable modules, update variables values

# [Project Website Name](https://example.com/)
This is the Drupal Composer Project with docksal configuration to easily get a site started.

Features:

- Drupal 8 - Composer Install
- Docksal Configuration
- Basic CircleCI configuration
- Project Readme

## Setup instructions

### Step #1: Docksal environment setup

**This is a one time setup - skip this if you already have a working Docksal environment.**

Follow [Docksal install instructions](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/setup/)

### Step #2: Project setup

1. Clone this repo into your Projects directory

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kanopi/starter-8.git drupal8
    cd drupal8
    ```

2. Initialize the site

    This will initialize local settings and install the site via drush

    ```
    fin init
    ```

3. **On Windows** add `fin hosts add` to your hosts file

4. Point your browser to

    ```
    http://drupal8.docksal
    ```

When the automated install is complete the command line output will display the admin username and password.

## Easier setup with `fin init`

Site provisioning can be automated using `fin init`, which calls the shell script in [.docksal/commands/init](.docksal/commands/init).
This script is meant to be modified per project. The one in this repo will give you a good example of advanced init script.

Some common tasks that can be handled by the init script:

- initialize local settings files for Docker Compose, Drupal, Behat, etc.
- import DB or perform a site install
- compile Sass
- run DB updates, revert features, clear caches, etc.
- enable/disable modules, update variables values

## Installing Modules

Modules are installed using composer. The process for installing a module would be the following:

```
fin composer require [package]
```

The standard composer command is used but with the Docksal specific command `fin` prepended to the beginning.

## Theme

The theme is based off of the Zurb Foundation framework. Gulp is installed and is helping with the compilation of the
sass to css. Additionally it is also helping with the minification of the javascript and css to make the code as minimal
as possible.

The theme included is located within `web/sites/themes/custom/site_theme`.

You should clone that, rename, and update the names in the file names and in the files.

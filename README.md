# [Drupal Starter](https://example.com/)
This is the Drupal Composer Project with docksal configuration to easily get a site started.

Features:

- Drupal 9 - Composer Install
- Docksal Configuration
- Basic CircleCI configuration
- Project Readme

Please make this README as project specific as possible. Delete the things that are not relevant or add new sections as needed.

### Pantheon setup

This repo is Pantheon specific at the moment

#### Create the project in Pantheon

* Create a new drupal **8** project. This is because the Drupal 9 integrated composer flow is a little janky.
![Create a new drupal 8 project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1062456/130299366-ad0699bd-3dc6-4148-9d8e-a8901e26bcce.png)

* Create a minimal site install

* Go to the Pantheon dashboard for your project.

* Click on the Team tab.

* Click on Add organization

* Search for Kanopi Studios (Important: enter the full term (Kanopi Studios) to find this - if you just enter Kanopi, you will end up with the wrong group and things will not work).

* Select and add Kanopi Studios.


#### Create project's Github repo
* Go to [https://github.com/kanopi/drupal-starter](https://github.com/kanopi/drupal-starter)

* Click on "Use this template" button.

* Make the owner Kanopi and the repo private, then click "Create repository from template"

* In the new repo, click on Settings and then the Manage Access tab.

* Click on "Invite teams or people" button.

* Search for and add Kanopi Studios and grant them Read access.

* Click on "Add kanopicode to this repository"

* Still in Settings, click on the Branches tab.

* Click on Add Rule.

* Make Branch name pattern match your default branch (e.g., main).

* Select "Require pull request reviews before merging"

* Click Create button

#### Update the files to be project specific

* Clone the new repo to your local.

* Create a development branch.

* Make the project specific changes listed below.

* Custom theme
    * Update the name of the theme folder to be project specific. `web/themes/custom/site_theme`

* Docksal
    * docksal.env
        * Update `hostingsite` to the machine name of the project in Pantheon
        * Update `THEME` to the name of the theme folder
        * `hostingenv` is set to `dev` to start but when you release the project to production it should be changed to `live`
    * settings.php
        * `.docksal/etc/conf/settings.php` is used for the local settings file for drupal.
    * vhost-overrides.conf
        * `.docksal/etc/nginx/vhost-overrides.conf`
        * Update the proxy url to use the pantheon machine name for the site you just created.
    * .pa11yci.js
        * Update the urls you would like to test in the array

    * `config.yml`
        * Update the `TERMINUS_SITE` variable in line 2 to your Pantheon machine name for the project.
        * Update the `THEME_NAME` variable in line 3 to the folder name for your custom theme.
        * Update paths in JSON lock files in theme
        * If you would like Slack notifications when builds complete uncomment the slack portion.  You will need to create a new CircleCI slack integration for the channel you want to post updates too and update the webhook URL.

* Run `fin init` to validate your local site.

* Run `fin drush cex -y`

* On a development branch, git add, commit and push all local changes.

* Create a PR in github.

* Circleci won't run this time because we haven't set it up yet. We need to commit the project-specific circleci config.yml first so we can setup circleci later.

* Merge PR (now we have our project-specific circleci config on the main branch so we can reference it from circleci). Circleci job will still not happen.

#### Circleci project setup

## Setup instructions

### Step #1: Docksal environment setup

**This is a one time setup - skip this if you already have a working Docksal environment.**

Follow [Docksal install instructions](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/setup/)

### Step #2: Project setup

1. Clone this repo into your Projects directory.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kanopi/drupal-starter.git drupal-starter
    cd drupal-starter
    ```

2. Initialize Lefthook Git Hooks

[Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) is used for configuring commands to run using githooks

   ```
   lefthook install
   ```

To install Lefthook the following commands can be done.

  ```
  sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/lefthook https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/releases/download/v0.7.7/lefthook_0.7.7_MacOS_x86_64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lefthook
  ```

3. Initialize the site.

    This will initialize local settings and install the site via drush

    ```
    fin init
    ```

4. Point your browser to

    ```
    http://drupal-starter.docksal
    ```

When the automated install is complete the command line output will display the admin username and password.

## Easier setup with `fin init`

Site provisioning can be automated using `fin init`, which calls the shell script in [.docksal/commands/init](.docksal-old/commands/init).
This script is meant to be modified per project. The one in this repo will give you a good example of advanced init script.

Some common tasks that can be handled by the init script:

- initialize local settings files for Docker Compose, Drupal, Behat, etc.
- import DB or perform a site install
- compile Sass
- run DB updates, revert features, clear caches, etc.
- enable/disable modules, update variables values

## Installing Modules

Modules are installed using composer. The process for installing a module would be the following:

```
fin composer require [package]
```

The standard composer command is used but with the Docksal specific command `fin` prepended to the beginning.

## Theme

The theme is based off the [Kanopi Design Component Library](https://github.com/kanopi/kdcl_basic) which uses Storybook and is originally forked from [Emulsify DS](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-drupal).

The theme included is located within `docroot/sites/themes/custom/THEME`.

The theme needs the following modules enabled: `fin drush en components emulsify_twig twig_tweak`

The Storybook Design System published to the `gh-pages` branch and is available
at https://kanopi.github.io/REPO_NAME/

Locally, running `fin npm run storybook` or `fin npm run build` will build the
Storybook at http://storybook.${VIRTUAL_HOST}

The theme uses Webpack and NPM to manage packages and run scripts.

- @TODO [Hot Reloading in Drupal](https://docs.emulsify.info/usage/hot-reload-drupal)

#### Storybook

- Theme development run `fin npm run develop`. This will watch for all twig, js, and sass changes within the components directory.
- The development storybook URL http://storybook.${VIRTUAL_HOST}

#### Storybook Webpack
For webpack storybook to work within a docksal container we needed to set `watchOptions` in `docroot/themes/custom/THEME/.storybook/webpack.config.js`
```
config.watchOptions = {
  aggregateTimeout: 200,
  poll: 1000,
}
```

## Project specific notes

Are there any projects specific quirks or setup that should be noted.

## Deployments

### Github to Pantheon
Deployments to the dev Pantheon environment is managed through Circle CI.

Pull requests will build a MultiDev environment and update the PR with a comment. We also have Lighthouse testing and other audits enabled.

Merges to `main` will merge Github to the Pantheon dev environment.During development our databases are Test and Dev. Once we have a launched product these will change to Live, Test and Dev.

### Pantheon dev to production
1. Go to the project dashboard on Pantheon.
1. Backup databases for Test and Dev.
    1. To accomplish this you can go to the backups tab and backup everything or go to Database/Files and under Export 'export the database'.
1. Go to the environment you want to deploy to and make note of the tickets that are ready to deploy, document these in the deploy log message.
1. Once content has been deployed clone the Test database down to Dev.
1. Pull the database locally, make sure there are no config changes that need to be committed to code. If there are changes, commit those and deploy.
1. Tell the appropriate Slack channel that a deployment has taken place and include which tickets were deployed.

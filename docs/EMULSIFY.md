# Emulsfy theme configuration

## NOTE: This repository is no longer configured to compile Emulsify.

Please refer to releases before 10.2.3 for that CircleCI/Docksal code.

The theme is based off the
[Kanopi Design Component Library](https://github.com/kanopi/kdcl_basic)
which uses Storybook and is originally forked from
[Emulsify DS](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-drupal).

The theme included is located within `docroot/sites/themes/custom/THEME`.

The Storybook Design System published to the `gh-pages` branch and is available
at https://kanopi.github.io/REPO_NAME/

Locally, running `fin npm run storybook` or `fin npm run build` will build the
Storybook at http://storybook.${VIRTUAL_HOST}

The theme uses Webpack and NPM to manage packages and run scripts.

[Hot Reloading in Drupal](https://docs.emulsify.info/usage/hot-reload-drupal)

## Storybook

- Theme development run `fin npm run develop`. This will watch for twig, js,
 and sass changes within the components directory.
- The development storybook URL http://storybook.${VIRTUAL_HOST}

## Storybook Webpack
For webpack storybook to work within a docksal container we needed
to set `watchOptions` in
`docroot/themes/custom/THEME/.storybook/webpack.config.js`
```
config.watchOptions = {
  aggregateTimeout: 200,
  poll: 1000,
}
```
